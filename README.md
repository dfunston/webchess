# webchess
A web based chess game using Javascript and HTML5 canvas.
Current implementation is local multiplayer only, but a websocket server is planned.
Additionally, while game will verify whether the kings are in check, currently checkmate is not implemented, and no win state has been implemented, allowing for an king to be captured and the game to continue.

TODO:
* Server implementation
* Checkmate
* Game creation
* Account system (considering using Wordpress to avoid custom implementation for this).
